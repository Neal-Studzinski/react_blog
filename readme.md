## Description

> Describe your application here and what it does

Create the UI for a blogging application using multiple react components.

The page should have 5 blog posts already on it, made with static data. Like we did in codepen today.

There should be a top level App component.

There should be a component that represents a single blog post or article.

The data to render the post's body, title, and publish data should be props that are passed in

There should be a component that represents a 'new post' form.

There should be an input for title, and a text area for body.

Each post component should be able to be collapsed via a button in the component using local state.
